# Norrland Mod - A19 Client

This is a mod I created to learn modding its the code base is RomeroMod by Khaine https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21581-romero-mod-a-game-modesuite-of-zombie-tweaks/
I have taken inspiration frome the 7 Years to die mod by Frantic Dan but not used the code https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/22254-7-years-to-die-survivor-desolate-interloper-exile-survivor-v116-a195-twitch-integration-not-supported/
I also want to say thanks to Temreki for helping me with one configuration file https://www.youtube.com/c/GunsNerdsandSteel
